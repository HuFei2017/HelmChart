# cassandra

[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) is a free and open-source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers or datacenters.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an [Apache Cassandra](http://172.16.0.8:30000/dmp/ronds_ipaas/tree/master/charts/cassandra) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
